# FY-DRUG-INVENTORY-AND-SUPPLY-CHAIN-TRACKING-SYSTEM
💊 Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Tracking System
📌 Overview
In recent years, the healthcare sector has undergone a dramatic transformation. However, one area remains critically underserved: the tracking and management of drug inventory across supply chains.

Current pharmaceutical logistics suffer from serious inefficiencies, including:

Expired stock

Counterfeit drugs

Drug shortages in rural areas

Significant financial losses

Traditional inventory systems are often manual or siloed, lacking real-time visibility and end-to-end traceability.
